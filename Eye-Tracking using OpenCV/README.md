## Overview

This notebook showcases a simple yet effective implementation of eye motion tracking using:

- **OpenCV** for video capture and image processing
- **Facial landmarks** detection to identify and isolate eye regions
- **Contour analysis** for determining pupil position
- **Real-time feedback** via a webcam stream

## Features

- Real-time eye tracking
- Visualization of eye movement and pupil detection
- Lightweight and easy-to-understand implementation
- Ready-to-run Jupyter Notebook
