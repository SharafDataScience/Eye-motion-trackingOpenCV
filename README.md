# Project 2: Face Tracking with Dlib & OpenCV
This project demonstrates real-time face detection and facial landmark tracking using **Dlib** and **OpenCV**. It uses Dlib's pre-trained 68-point facial landmark predictor to identify key points on detected faces through a webcam feed, Better and more acurate then project 1.
