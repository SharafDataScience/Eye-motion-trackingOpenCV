# Project 1: üëÅÔ∏è Eye Motion Tracking with OpenCV 

Track and visualize real-time eye movements using computer vision techniques powered by OpenCV. This project demonstrates how to capture and analyze gaze direction using a webcam feed ‚Äî useful for research, accessibility tech, or just for fun.

# Project 2: Face Tracking with Dlib & OpenCV
This project demonstrates real-time face detection and facial landmark tracking using **Dlib** and **OpenCV**. It uses Dlib's pre-trained 68-point facial landmark predictor to identify key points on detected faces through a webcam feed, Better and more acurate then project 1.

# Project 3:: Drowsy Face Detection with OpenCV and Facial Landmarks
This project demonstrates a simple yet effective way to detect drowsiness using facial landmarks and OpenCV. It tracks eye aspect ratio (EAR) in real-time via webcam, and alerts the user when signs of drowsiness (e.g., prolonged eye closure) are detected.
